# cuboid-sdl
------------

This is a rewrite of Pedro Martins' [cuboid](https://github.com/pedromartins/cuboid)

This was an attempt to try and understand FRP library Yampa (and frp in
general).

Just as an exercise I decided to use SDL2 with OpenGL instead of running using
GLUT. As a result (not being familiar with OpenGL) I couldn't make my code run
(compile yes, run no).

I did learn a lot about FRP though and understand bits of Yampa much better now.
So at least some progress was achieved (basically my main goal).
